title: Quick introduction to my blog date: 22-05-2021 tags: test, post summary: In this post, I tell you why I finally started a blog and how I built it :)

Hi, I decided to start this blog after finding out a lot of wholesome blogs from people my age who were speaking about pretty much everything online. Notably, the blog post from Alexrey Guzey [Why you should start a blog right now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) really made me want to move my ass and start writing online. 

I can't agree more with what he says :

- There's plenty of things to write about
- It doesn't matter that nobody is reading this
- Writing helps to think better
- It's OK not to be original

This blog is a way for me to fight my general online shyness (I'm a big time lurker) and to improve my english writing (still, I'll post french stuff from time to time).

I used Flask to build this blog because I want to serve self-made tensorflow ML models on it and staying within a python framework was appealing. I could have used a wordpress or something easier to start with, but building this blog was a great way to procrastinate :)
